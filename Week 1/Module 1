    <p>
This week I covered the following:
    </p>
    <p>
<h2>1.Git and Github </h2>
    </p>
- Here I learnt about the different command prompts for both windows and git.
<br>
- I also looked at different git concepts such as;
<li>Repositories</li>
<li>Branches</li>
<li>Push and pull requests</li>
- Using what I learnt I was able to create my github account and also created both a local and online repository.
<br>
- After creating my repositories I was able to add files using the commands; git add and git commit.
<p>
<h3>2.HTML and CSS</h3>
- I first started by looking at notes on HTML which then helped me in creating my website.<br>
- I also implemented certain aspects of CSS in creating my website.<br>
- I also used hyperlinks and different styles i.e background and text color to improve my website's look.
<p>
<h4>3.Markdown</h4>
Description; Markdown is a markup language used for adding formatting to plain text documents.
<p>
- Based on the description I was able to use markdown to change the format of some words i.e bold and italic formats.
